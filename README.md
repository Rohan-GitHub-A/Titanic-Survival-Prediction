# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction
This project focuses on predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. Leveraging the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle, the model analyzes features such as age, sex, class, and fare to determine the likelihood of survival.

📌 Project Overview
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. In this project, we apply data science techniques to explore the dataset, clean and preprocess the data, visualize key insights, and build predictive models that estimate whether a passenger survived.

🔍 Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Seaborn and Matplotlib
Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling null values, encoding categorical variables)
Feature engineering for improved model performance
Model training using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost
Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
Visualizations for better understanding of survival factors

🛠️ Tech Stack
